      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Inception follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in stealing
        secrets from deep within the subconscious during dreams. He is offered
        a chance to erase his criminal past by performing the impossible task
        of inception—planting an idea into someone’s mind. As dreams layer
        within dreams, the line between reality and imagination begins to blur.
